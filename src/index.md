I am a full stack JavaScript developer. I am a motivated developer, and Builder. 

A CoderDad, and Creative.\
I have been building and creating online for the last four years, while working full time at my local hospital and raising my family. It has been a wild journey.

I will be documenting my thoughts and journey here.
