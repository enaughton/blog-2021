Last week was Spotify Wrapped week, and now there is a round of layoffs at Spotify. :( It Triggers some PTSD for me just hearing about layoffs....

Are there any cool songs you found this year? Please share!

FOMO: This week [Future Commerce](https://futurecommerce.com) is hosting an ***INCREDIBLE*** event in Miami part of Art Basel. 
Called [Muses](https://www.futurecommerce.com/muses)

If you can make it, Tell Phillip I sent ya.
