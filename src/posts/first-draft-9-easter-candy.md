There was an Easter I remember to well growing up. I gave up chocholate and sweets for Lent (I was attended 3-4th grdae at a Catholic school). We were visiting family in Virgina, and I kid you not I got my body weight in candy and chocolate. That day I learned you can sick from eating to much candy. Weird.
