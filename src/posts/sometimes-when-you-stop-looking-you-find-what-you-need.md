## It's amazing how life happens sometimes. 

There were at least a dozen rejections with the feedback, of "Not Technical enough", "We went another route, but keep applying.", "You aren't Coding fast enough.", "You will never make it as a developer if you aren't working full time on building stuff." and many other hard-to-swallow pills. All of the rough news in the last couple months. 

But I was determined to recover and get back up. 
Recovery for me was stepping away from VS Code. 
Being present with my kids and wife. Playing video games always helped, and not worrying about another year of not being in tech try not to crush all of my dreams. It was a heavy weight on my chest.(

The journey started out as me being a janitor and getting home around midnight every night. To new jobs within the hospital. All this time I was still coding on the side, and networking on Twitter. Doing calls and interviews on my lunch break or driving home from work. 
Really pushing to get to where I am today. 

I want to share with everybody that I will be joining [Govalo](https://govalo.com/) as a Software Engineer in January. It feels unbelievable. I may have been ugly crying since I got the offer letter. This has been a long time coming, and I am ready to get to work.
