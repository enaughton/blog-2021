W﻿e see so much polish and shine in our daily lives, that we even get to the point of not wanting to start anything unless we know that the final product will be shiny and "Worth It". 

I﻿ personally want more RAW, unfiltered things. When I ask "How are you doing?" DO NOT give me "Living the dream" reply I've heard in the hallways and factory floors. Most of those people had DREAMS and it probably wasn't working in an ER during the Pandemic, or making shiny beautiful lighting fixtures for fancy hotels, they would never set foot in or get to witness in person. 

G﻿ive me the real, "Things are hard, but we are getting through it." responses. We can talk about it. We are all dealing with some stuff. 


P﻿ost the Ugly, Raw, Unfiltered moments. Share your struggles with me and others. You will start to feel better.
