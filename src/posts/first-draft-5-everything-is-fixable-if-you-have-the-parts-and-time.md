I fing myself driving around trying to a replacement heating element for our dryer. Of course every place wants you to just buy a new thing, and forget about fixing the machine. Of course the added stress of the ever growing laundry mountain, watching your child spill ketchup on their fifth clean shirt of the day at 7pm, knowing your dryer is broken. 

Can I hang dry the clothes sure. but who has space to individually hang 10 loads worth of laundry! 

Laundry will forever haunt my dreams.
