These aren't a list of goals, that I'll reflect on in a year.

This is the **_Wouldn't it be Cool TO-DO List_**

1. Be a Speaker at an Event

   - This can be an Ecom/Tech event
   - My Journey should be one of hope and inspiration
   - I bring a unique perspective on life, and work. 

2. Podcast

   - This one has been on the list for years. I never felt like I have a quiet enough space or enough to talk about.
   - Thinking of this being a Captain's Log style podcast. Where I give small updates on my week. Interesting things I've learned from work, "HOT DRAMA", and other discoveries along the way.
   - Looking for Space Themed logo and intro music

3. Document/Prototype
   
   - One thing I want to get better at this year is documenting my processes and building sharable prototypes of my ideas. 
   - Prototypes are a great way show progress and steps in the process to the final product. 
   - In the past, I often struggled with jumping into the deep-end of a project and needing someone to rescue me later when I got in over my head. 

4. Keep up on Maintenance
 
   - Yard Work. I hate every bit about it, but like to have a decent looking yard and home. 
   - Personal health. After last year finding out some not so fun health information. Time to try and be better about taking care of my body. 


A list of some of "GOALS" I think would be cool to do this year.
