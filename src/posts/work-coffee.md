Sure, a nice cup of coffee is an incredible gift. 

But I truly believe that coffee during work shouldn't be INCREDIBLE. It should be diner-level. Work Coffee is a tool, to put you in the zone. 

There is something meditative about the folgers can, and a white mug. The ritual of making a cup of coffee is more important the quality of beans to me. 

I try to limit the coffee during the weekend. Mostly to be able to handle the chaos that is children and house work. Coffee plus lots of stress triggers anxiety much quicker than not having it. 

Biggest thing I've been thinking about is switching to a Tea in the afternoon. One to help with sleep, but also to avoid the "on accident" 4pm cup of coffee. Thats been happening more often than I'd like.
