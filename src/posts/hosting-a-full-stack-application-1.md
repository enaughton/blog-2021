Most front-end projects can be hosted for free online, using something like Github Pages or Netlify. Now a full-stack application with a database or an API makes things more complicated.

I finished this project a year ago. Why has it taken this long to get shared? There is not a straightforward solution to hosting this type of project.Â 

It has a React front-end, with a custom-built REST API with Express using Sequelize ORM to use SQLite3 for the database.

The solution I came up with was to host the REST API and database on Glitch.com. Host the React front-end on Netlify.

This project was a ton of fun to complete. It feels even better that I get to share it with you.
