Most front end projects can be hosted for free online, using something like Github Pages or Netlify, or say a Codepen. 

Now a full stack application with a database and/or API that makes things a little more complicated. 

This project I am talking about was completed a year ago. I am just now getting around to getting it **Live** for the world to see my work? Why is that? 

Well there isnâ€™t a striaght forward solution to get the specific stack hosted and living on the web. 

the stack is a react front end, with a custom built REST API with Express using Sequelize ORM to use the SQLite3 database.
