I often wonder with places like twitter, is just different people of influence taking turns playing peek-a-boo and we are giggle about it after the recess bell rings and go back to our day-to-day.

You don't need to throw that sponsored dinner, if the only people attending are already on your email list.

If you are bragging about hustling and HAVING to work weekends, stop writing threads during the work day!


Oh ya, and those threads should be a blog post on your personal site.
