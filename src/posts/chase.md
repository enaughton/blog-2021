There have been times recently where I've felt very stuck mostly with work. 

The biggest thing that has helped me get unstuck is cleaning up my work space, and getting the house picked up. Cleaning up the house with kids is never easy and constantly on the back of my mind. But bringing that to the forefront, I can let the work task simmer.

When I come back to the work task I have a clearer start and tend to finish the task quicker than just trying to push through.
