The first part of the title is what I saw on my phone this afternoon. Generally, thats not good news. Especially, coming from work. My jaw and neck locked up. 

I drop what I was doing, and jump into the call. Finally, the second part of the message pops up on my phone.

## A RAISE?!

This is the first time in my career. Not a cost of living adjustment (Hey, those are pretty helpful too).


Ever since the call and the conversation. I've been a bit emotional. I've worked so hard to get where I am today. 
Work feels like play. The team I work with everyday is incredible. 
 
I am a better engineer than I was. 
Cannot wait to show you what we have planned this year.

Thanks [Jeremiah](https://twitter.com/JeremiahPrummer) for betting on me.
