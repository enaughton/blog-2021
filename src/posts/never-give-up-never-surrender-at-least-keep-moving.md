[Jason Lengstorf]([https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) was doing an #EggheadChat on Twitter and I asked him: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finished my paid client project. Now what?!? What would you say the next step to getting a full time role should be? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EggHeadChat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EggHeadChat</a></p>&mdash; emmett naughton (@EmmettNaughton) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmettNaughton/status/1357486945119707136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

His answer didn't surprise me at all, I subconsiously know what I need to do to go to the next level. But it always helps to hear it from somebody you look up too. 
His response: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">keep going. do the next thing that you&#39;re interested in, build something for yourself, look for that next client, keep putting yourself out there. it starts slow, but once the foundation is laid it \*will\* pay off! <a href="https://t.co/rvtDoqX2HU">pic.twitter.com/rvtDoqX2HU</a></p>&mdash; Jason Lengstorf (@jlengstorf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1357488776981872640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I am now looking into what could I do in the next 12 weeks to get to that full time developer role.
I will never give up, and I sure as hell will never survrender.
