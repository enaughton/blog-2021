### So 2021 was supposed to be my year. 
I was having my third kid, had paternity leave to try and get that full time developer role that I've been hustling towards. Its been frustrating, and there is plenty of people who have started after me, and landed their jobs with their dream company. 

A lot of this comes down to me having a full time job in an Emergency Room, and having been there throughout the pandemic. Which has given me countless experiences of dealing with caring for patients and their needs. 

But part of me feels like "Damn, this is the 4th year that I'm not in tech yet. What the hell is wrong me?" (5 Years in March 2022 of learning and building for the web).

However, this won't stop me from continuing to show up and make lasting important relationships in the tech community until I am fulling in it. 

I am pivoting to just get into tech. I am going to use my experience of working in the Emergency Room, to customer support or success.

I have the experience and the drive to be in Tech. I know I belong there.
