### So 2021 was supposed to be my year. 
I was having my third kid, had paternity leave to try and get that full time developer role that I've been hustling towards. Its been frustrating, and there is plenty of people who have started after me, and landed their jobs with their dream company. 

A lot of this comes down to me having a full time job in an Emergency Room, and have been there throughout the pandemic. Which has given me countless experience of making sure patients feel comfortable, and able to talk to them to obtain information.
