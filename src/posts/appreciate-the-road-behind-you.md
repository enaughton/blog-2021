I﻿t's strange to think about where I was professionally when my first child was born. 

I﻿ was working making Chandeliers like this one. [Link](https://www.build.com/product/summary/1545789?uid=3639318&jmtest=gg-gbav2_3639318&inv=1&&&&&&source=gg-gba-pla_3639318!c1711171879!a67979266278!dc!ng&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9fqnBhDSARIsAHlcQYT1LbiUCiaQYdbh3ayKLqQtC6vEARfx2u-Tvp9KffTGITRZWX7NbRAaAt5xEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

This turned into being a Janitor in a hospital, then that turned into working in Patient Registration in the ER during the Pandemic. This also in a time where I grew my family, bought a new home, and was teaching myself to build software (On the side, cause I didn't have enough to do). 

T﻿hat doesn't even begin to consider my jobs before kids, of building city busses, or being line cook. Or Booking shows, Playing shows, Touring, and running shows. For little or losing money. 

I﻿ think all of these experiences with different jobs is a bonus skill that I am thankful for. 

I﻿ won't ask anybody to do anything, I wouldn't do myself.
