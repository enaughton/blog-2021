This is always been something that I've been thinking about since having kids. As a parent, seeing the world slowly starting to burn while you watch your kids playing at the park really makes you think about things. 

If enough wonderful people have children, and we collectively build communites and places for them to thrive. We can change the world. 

I want to be apart of something BIG, meaningful work is important to me. Not something that I can just flex about at a reunion. But something that I know my daily work is changing somebody elses life.

We can build incredible things, and help make the world better.
