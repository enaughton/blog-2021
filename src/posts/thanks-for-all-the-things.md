This year has been a wild one. But looking back to where I was this time last year to now. I am in the right place. I wouldn't be where I am today, without some incredible people placing bets on me.

First off, Thanks to [Kelly Vaughn](https://twitter.com/kvlly) and [Rhian Beutler](https://twitter.com/rhiankatie) for bringing me into the [Govalo](https://govalo.com/) team earlier this year. I learned so many incredible things there.

Next, I cannot express my gratitude enough for the team over at Luro. So many thanks to [﻿Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/), [﻿Trent Walton](https://trentwalton.com/), and [﻿Reagan Ray](https://reaganray.com/) for giving me the opportunity to help build parts of [Luro](https://luroapp.com/). I got to build some incredible things. I have so much respect for what this team is working on. 


Also, everybody that has been a part of [CoderDads](https://coderdads.carrd.co/), this community has seen so many wild things happen. Dads landing their first jobs in tech, being able to buy their first house. Many other incredible stories in that community. 

I am hopeful about where my next journey starts, but looking back at the wonderful people I have gotten to work with, brings me an overwhelming sense of joy.
