February 29th.  Comes every 4 years. Gave me the idea to do something **BOLD** and **WILD**. 

It started with a silly Twitter DM.  

`Sign up for our "Leap Day Coffee Club." Every 4 years you get a cup from us! $2.99/month` 

Price: to be determined  
Limit: 500  
Delivery: February 2028

Comes with monthly updates on the process of designing/sourcing/packaging. 

Would love suggestions on price or other ideas. 

Yes I know 4 years in internet time is a LONG time.
Is this something you'd be interested in doing and partaking in?
