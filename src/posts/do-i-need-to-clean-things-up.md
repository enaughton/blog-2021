Today I cleaned out the water kettle that I use for making coffee.
It is something that needs to get done way more often than it does.

W﻿hich got me thinking about job hunting and my social presence. Are there things on my profiles that I need to clean out and get ready for a successful job search process?

T﻿his got me looking back at my old [CodePens](https://codepen.io/emmettnaughton) or my [Github Repos](https://github.com/enaughton) *cringe*

L﻿ooking back through the things I've built made me realize even through a lot of is junk. These are the small projects and prototypes that got me to where I am today as a builder.

I want to focus on building more prototypes this year and more sharing. Being able to explain "this is what I've done" goes a long way in improving knowledge. I want to focus on building more prototypes this year.
