The adventures of changing careers and finding something I truly enjoy doing took a lot out of me. I let a lot of my health stuff slide. Last year around this time my doctor sent me for some tests. 

S﻿trees of working in the ER in the Pandemic, while trying to change careers for my family. 

Well, after Dozen of phone calls and a couple tests. Turns out I have a moderate heart condition as well as severe sleep apnea. Both of these issues are related, of course. 


B﻿ut, right now two more sleeps until I get a machine that will give me a restful night of sleep. I will give my wife peace of mind at night. There have been times of me getting shaken awake because I have stopped breathing in my sleep.

Excited to track my results and sleep. There are some open source monitoring programs that I could use to build some models of how I have been sleeping. (PROJECT SLEEP)


T﻿his is also a reminder not to skip the basic appointments. This stuff is important.
