Most people will tell you the ideas they have, the dreams they have of building something that will change their life. Not maybe actually take the leap of faith though. Its hard. 

I try my best to help the builders, share their hard work. 
I can shout out a few projects I'm in Awe of currently. Some of the cool things my friends are working on.
