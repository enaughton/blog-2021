This project was a lot of fun, and can be shared easily with friends who want to add their reading list to the project. \

I was playing around in Glitch.com a week or so ago, I noticed you could just import a github repo. 

I had some projects that were built using SQLite3, and would need to migrate the database to something a Heroku or Vercel could host. \
\
I imported the repo into Glitch and **BOOM!** I got the Live link with a working project. \
\
This got me thinking of the other projects I had built out to be hosted online for free using Glitch. \

Feel free to add your favorite books to the list!
