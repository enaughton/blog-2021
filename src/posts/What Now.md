# Now what?!

The last several months have been stressful, and draining. I've been meaning to write more, but with everything going on, its been hard!

I am starting my habit now, because with the new year I plan to write more and talk more what I've been learning on a weekly basis. My journey into tech has been unique but a wilder rollercoaster of ups and down, and some LONG nights and earlier mornings.

Heres to habits, to create the life I want.
