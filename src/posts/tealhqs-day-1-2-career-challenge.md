Starting yesterday, I commited to working through [TealHq](http://tealhq.com/) 30 day Career Challenge. I have roughly spent the last four years learning and building. This is the first time I have taken the job search seriously. So far I have learned a lot about my Work Styles, and how I work. It's important to reflect on this because I am normally thinking of a game plan, but this challenge forces me to get out of my comfort zone. 



I am trying to keep myself accountable through this process, so come back to see my progress!
