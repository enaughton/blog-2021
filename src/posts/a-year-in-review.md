The year in review. Looking back at where I was even a year ago I have improved and grown so much.

First off, I've got to work with incredibly smart and wonderful people. That is a HUGE plus, and made the hard parts of this year bareable. 

I've was given the opporuntity twice this year to get in on some very cool companies building really interesting things.
