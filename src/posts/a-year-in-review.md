First, I've got to work with wonderful people, which helped make the challenging parts of this year bearable. 

I got the opportunity twice this year to get in on some very cool companies building exciting products.

# [Govalo](https://govalo.com)
I got to work on making online gifting better and more accessible to brands, and who doesn't like getting gifts?

- Built features to help get over 500 merchants to use Govalo as their gifting platform. 
- Learned Typescript
- Built an email redemption app
- Contextual Savebar
- A lot of customizations 
- Knowing things I built helped merchants pad their stats on BFCM
-  Over 270 contributions from Jan-May 2022 

#  [Luro](https://luroapp.com)
I worked with an incredible group. 
- Over 319 contributions 
- Learned Vue/Nuxt
- Learned Prisma
- Built multiple features
- Leveled up my UI skills


Here are some stats!

Those were just professional achievements. 
Here are the things that happened too.

## [#CoderDads](https://coderdads.carrd.co)

- Broke 250 Dads
- Saw many Dads get their first tech jobs. 
- Homes bought

Very thankful for this community that has watched me ride the tidal waves of moving from a busy ER job to a tech job. CoderDads helped me through 2 layoffs this year.  

I was on some podcasts/live streams this year! If you have a podcast, I would love to come on and share my story.

It's been a wild year.
I am looking for my next adventure. I am working on a few personal projects now. 
I am going into the New Year rested and ready to be an asset to my next company.
