This is something, I have wanted to try for awhile. Just like most of the things on my project list, the list grows with ideas but not many items get checked off. 

So this will be an attempt. First Drafts is the idea that hitting publish/deploy on the thing you are working on just to get it out in the world is OK.

Trying to post once a day for the Month of April. Follow along. These will be a wide range of topics and brain dumps. 

Hope to see you through the month!
