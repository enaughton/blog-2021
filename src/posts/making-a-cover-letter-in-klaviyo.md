E﻿ver since working at Govalo, where I watched the team launch a Klaviyo intergration. My interest in email and how all of that works behind the scenes. With being on the job hunt again, I figured why not apply to Klaviyo but use the tools they provide for customers to help boost my application. 

F﻿irst I built out my cover letter as an email template!

A﻿nother incredibly powerful tool Klaviyo just launched is an SMS AI Copy tool. Which I used to build a text message style cover letter!
