title: Making a Cover Letter in Klaviyo

E﻿ver since working at Govalo, where I watched the team launch a Klaviyo integration. My curiosity about email and how all of that works behind the scenes has grown. With being on the job hunt again, I figured why not apply to Klaviyo but use the tools they provide for customers to help boost my application?

F﻿irst, I built out my cover letter as an email template!

A﻿nother incredibly powerful tool Klaviyo just launched is an SMS AI Copy tool. Which I used to build a text-message-style cover letter.
T﻿he link sends a user to my resume.

T﻿his was a fun project, and application process.
