Changing careers is hard. It's not as easy as a lot of "hustlers" say it is. Putting in 40+ draining hours at a place then coming home to do the work that you really enjoy is A LOT. 

Having somebody that can hold you accountable for keeping motivated has been super helpful. Another thing is find an online community of supportive internet friends.
Sharing your progress and struggles is important. A lot of the stories I heard that motivated me to get into tech, were like "Learn to code, get a job making $90k/year after 3 months of learning." 

Clearly that isn't true for everybody, I've done 4 years of hard work and dedication and I am just now getting somewhere. its amazing to me how much I have accomplished in this time frame. 

Working full time, raising a family, being the sole provider for my family.

The hardest part is the mental toughness needed to get through all of this, while dreading going to work everyday while also keeping laser like focus on my goals and dreams for my family.
