Finding time to code can be difficult. There are many stories of people learning to code in three months full time. However, I do not have the luxury of taking three months off of working full time to do that.
My average day:
7am: wake up (give or take 15minutes).
7:30: bring wife to work for 8am
8:15: Come home, let dogs out, make breakfast for me and my son. Let dogs in.
8:30–9am: pick up house, and other random chores.
9am–1pm: chase toddler around the house.
1pm: make lunch get ready to pick wife from work at 1:30.
2pm: get home, get ready for work.
2:30pm: leave for work.
3–11:30pm: work
11:45: get home, let dogs out final time. Put dogs to bed.
12:30am: bed
It’s been about a year since I started to learn to code. But a big motivator is listening to podcasts while at work.
I know I’ll get web developer job at some point in the future! I just have to be patient and work hard when I get a moment or two of free time.
