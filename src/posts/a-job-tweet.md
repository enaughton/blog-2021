After being motivated to create a "Looking for Job" Tweet by [Jamon](https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren). He wrote an article about what to put in the tweet. 

[Crafting an Effective looking for work Tweet ](https://medium.com/@jamonholmgren/crafting-an-effective-looking-for-work-tweet-c888bbc7aa90)

[My Job Tweet](https://twitter.com/EmmettNaughton/status/1350795379135156235)

I fired this off on Sunday morning, and **wooooo** boy. It took off. The most rewarding thing about the tweet is that I got some amazing shout outs from people I truly admire in tech. I know I am on the right path, I belong in tech.
