T﻿his time of year always feels like a lot. Changing seasons, winter very quickly on my doorstep. There is a TON of things to do before that happens. 

T﻿his got me thinking about mental load of having a family and career. There are things that I take full responsibility to not thinking about things that keeps my wife up at night. Its not that I don't care, but I tend to struggle with "out of side out of mind".

G﻿uilty of not taking some of the mental load away, but will totally do the work that needs to happen to complete the task. 

Y﻿esterday was clearing out the backyard of all the toys, and trash from the summer and getting it into the garage to get ready for trash day.

T﻿his year I will try to do better to keep less mental load on my wife. Its the stuff we don't see that is the heaviest load. 


T﻿hinking is often WAY harder than just doing.
