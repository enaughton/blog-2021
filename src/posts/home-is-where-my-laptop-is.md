I﻿ am forever the green dot (online). As somebody who is in small city USA, finding places where people had similar interests has been  a  struggle. Which help push me to start #CoderDads (community for Dads that Code). So much of the advice I was given was to attend events, or go to conferences, I was making less than $40k/year as the sole provider plus time off was a PAIN to deal with, needing at least 4-6 months of advanced notice. 

I﻿ tend to be very responsive even if its "after/before" hours of work. Sure that can be a sign of toxic hustle culture, but I genuinely enjoy what I do for work. I also view work as being able to free up time for others on the team so they can shine at what they do best. 

T﻿here is probably a 95% chance I Have a laptop screen open within arms reach of me most days.
