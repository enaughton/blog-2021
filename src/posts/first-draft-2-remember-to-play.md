Things happen. Work, house chores, laundry (there is a mountain of it), dishes. Remembering to eat. 

Life gets busy. We get it, but taking time to play is important. Make that silly song about how you threw a spoon in the garbage disposal. Have a dance off with your partner or children. Be weird, go play. \
\
End of your life isn’t what’s in bank accounts it’s number of laughs and memories created. Sure money, and a living are important. But just like these posts, they are moments that we remember.



Go be weird, the internet is a place where the games are made up, and the points don’t matter. But please go play.
